# Crypt2
Command line extension for encrypting and decrypting files with a block cypher

## Description
Crypt2 is a command line extention for encrypting and decrypting files. It uses a block cypher and a symetric key, as well as a password. A key encypted by the password is stored localy. To use the key the password is used to decrypt the encrypted key. The key is then used with the block cypher on bytes from a file. However, I made some major redesignes and so I just moved to Crypt3.
